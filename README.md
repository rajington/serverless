The Serverless Framework is the application framework for building web, mobile and IoT applications on serverless, event-driven compute services, like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google CloudFunctions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) and more.

The Framework is a command line interface that provides scaffolding, automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.

This is maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team. For updates, join our [mailing list](http://github.us11.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b4fad36768cab222f88338995&id=5f8407dded).  For help, join our [gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/serverless/serverless).  Everyone is welcome!

## Status

The Serverless Framework v.1.0 is currently under construction. While the Alpha releases have high code quality and the implemented features can be used we don't have 100% feature parity with 0.5 yet. If you're starting a new project we
advise to start with 1.0 right away.

## Features

* Manage the lifecycle of your serverless architecture (build, deploy, update, delete)
* Group functions into services for easy management of code, resources & processes across large projects and teams
* Support for AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google CloudFunctions & more
* Safely, easily deploy functions, events and their required resources
* Minimal configuration and scaffolding
* Built-in support for multiple stages
* Optimized for CI/CD workflows
* Loaded with automation, optimization and best practices
* 100% Extensible: Extend or modify the Framework and its operations via Plugins
* An ecosystem of serverless services and plugins
* A fantastic and welcoming community!

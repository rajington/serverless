# Understanding Serverless

Here we'll take a deep dive into the internals of Serverless and understand what a service is and how functions relate
to a service.

Additionally we look at the Serverless key pieces of each service which are the [`serverless.yml`](serverless-yml.md)
and [`serverless.env.yml`](serverless-env-yml.md) files.

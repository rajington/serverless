# Overview of event sources

Here's a list of all available event sources grouped by provider.

**Note:** This list will be updated constantly as we're adding more and more event sources in the future.
Just open up an [issue](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues) if you have any wishes regarding event support.

The examples will show you how you can use the different event definitions.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### S3

#### Simple event definition

This will create a `photos` bucket which fires the `resize` function when an object is added or modified inside the bucket.

```yml
functions:
  resize:
    handler: resize
    events:
      - s3: photos
```

#### Extended event definition

This will create a bucket `photos`. The `users` function is called whenever an object is removed from the bucket.

```yml
functions:
  users:
    handler: users.handler
    events:
      - s3:
          bucket: photos
          event: s3:ObjectRemoved:*
```

### Schedule

#### Simple event definition

This will attach a schedule event and causes the function `crawl` to be called every 2 hours.

```yml
functions:
  crawl:
    handler: crawl
    events:
      - schedule: rate(2 hours)
```

#### Extended event definition

This will create and attach a schedule event for the `aggregate` function which is disabled. If enabled it will call
the `aggregate` function every 10 minutes.

```yml
functions:
  aggregate:
    handler: statistics.handler
    events:
      - schedule:
          rate: rate(10 minutes)
          enabled: false
```

### HTTP endpoint

#### Simple event definition

This will create a new HTTP endpoint which is accessible at `users/show` via a `GET` request. `show` will be called
whenever the endpoint is accessed.

```yml
functions:
  show:
    handler: users.show
    events:
      - http: GET users/show
```

#### Extended event definition

This will create a new HTTP endpoint which is accessible at `posts/create` with the help of the HTTP `POST` method.
The function `create` is called every time someone visits this endpoint.

```yml
functions:
  create:
    handler: posts.create
    events:
      - http:
          path: posts/create
          method: POST
```

**Note:** Serverless supports a built in, universal velocity request template which makes the following parameters available
in the `event` object:

- body
- method
- principalId
- headers
- query
- path
- identity
- stageVariables

To e.g. access the `body` parameter you can simply write `event.body`.

### SNS

#### Simple event definition

Here we create a new SNS topic with the name `dispatch` which is bound to the `dispatcher` function. The function will be
called every time a message is sent to the `dispatch` topic.

```yml
functions:
  dispatcher:
    handler: dispatcher.dispatch
    events:
      - sns: dispatch
```

#### Extended event definition

This event definition ensures that the `aggregator` function get's called every time a message is sent to the
`aggregate` topic. `Data aggregation pipeline` will be shown in the AWS console so that the user can understand what the
SNS topic is used for.

```yml
functions:
  aggregator:
    handler: aggregator.handler
    events:
      - sns:
          topic_name: aggregate
          display_name: Data aggregation pipeline
```

### Alexa Skills Kit

This will create a permission to allow the function to be invoke the
function when the skill is spoken

```yaml
functions:
    resize:
        handler: quiz.handler
        events:
            - ask
```
